# todo-backend

I have created a full stack web app for adding todo tasks. This is the backend part with graphQl and mongoose. 

# Main functionalities:
- It implements the login part with libraries like jsonwebtoken and decrypt.
- With this implementation, you are also able to create a file, a folder and add a file to the correspondent folder.
